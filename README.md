### Adidas Webstore Shoe Data Analysis

## Key Insights
I recently worked on an Adidas Webstore Shoe Data Analysis to uncover key business insights. Here are key findings:              
1Ô∏è‚É£ The webstore has generated $30M in total revenue with 299K total sales, indicating strong business performance.                        
2Ô∏è‚É£ Germany leads the market, generating $20.8M in sales, far ahead of other countries.                        
3Ô∏è‚É£ Core Black is the most popular shoe color, with 10M+ sales.                                                           
4Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue peaked in January ($6.3M) but saw a decline in the following months.                                                       
5Ô∏è‚É£ Tensaur Hook and Loop is the top-selling shoe, selling 6.2K units.                                                                        
6Ô∏è‚É£ Running shoes dominate sales, contributing 37.72% of total revenue.                                                                                    
7Ô∏è‚É£ Since running shoes are the most popular category, Adidas can expand its product line or enhance marketing efforts for this category.                                   
8Ô∏è‚É£The UK has the lowest sales (only $0.2M), showing potential for market expansion.
